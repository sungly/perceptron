Perceptron:

- If output is unsatisfactory, modify each weight by a quantity that is likely
to imrpove the network. 

- learn relationship between an input and output data

Symbols:
    Y - actual output
    (Di - Y) is the error, where D is the desire output vectors: (input, desire output)
    f() is the output function
    0 is the threshold 

2 Types:

Simple feedback learning:
    - uses (y>=d) or (y<d) to change weights 
    if (y > d):
        Wji = Wji - CXi

Error Correction learning
    - uses an error measure to adapt the weight vector
